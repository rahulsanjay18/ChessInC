Save File Formatting:

	- Read and Written byte by byte
	- one byte at the top for chkmate and movecolor (space for 6 more bools)
	- Then placement of pieces:
		- First the piece name appears (1 byte)
		- Then, the next sequence of bytes (likely a max of 8) gives each of the locations they are on (1 byte)
	- Then moves to execute (for testing only):
		- 1 byte each, move this pos to this pos
	
	Example of new game (showing the first piece):
		
		00000001 <- Says its white's move and there is no checkmate
		
		00000001 00000001 00010001 00100001 00110001 01000001 01010001 01100001 01110001 11111111<- white pawn
        
        wht pawn x(0)y(1) x(1)y(1) x(2)y(1) x(3)y(1) x(4)y(1) x(5)y(1) x(6)y(1) x(7)y(1)

Testing Plan:

	- Use files to write test board layouts
		- give location pair (letter, #) & character
		- some sort of break, then moves to test
		

Things to test:
- Pieces:
For each piece, test all moves, failed moves, captures
	- Pawn (13)
		- wht Pawn 2 spaces at row 2
		- wht Pawn 2 spaces at row 7 (FAIL)
		- blk Pawn 2 spaces at row 2 (FAIL)
		- blk Pawn 2 spaces at row 7
		- Pawn 2 spaces in wrong place (FAIL)
		- Pawn 2 spaces w/ piece in the way (FAIL)
		- Pawn 1 space
		- Pawn 3 spaces (FAIL)
		- Pawn -1 space (FAIL)
		- Pawn SIDE 1 space (FAIL)
		- Pawn capture left
		- Pawn capture right
		- Pawn capture L shape (FAIL)
	- Knight (9)

		- Down and Left
		- Left and Down
		- Up and Right
		- Right and Up
		- Down and Right
		- Right and Down
		- Straight 3 spaces (FAIL)
	- Bishop (36)
		- Start at bottom-left corner, work up until you reach upper-right corner (8)

		- Start at upper-right corner, work up until you reach bottom-left corner (8)
		- Start at bottom-right corner, work up until you reach upper-left corner (8)
		- Move piece so another piece is in the way
		- Move up 3 spaces (FAIL)
		- Move right 3 spaces (FAIL)
		- Move L space (FAIL)
	- Rook (18)
		- Start at one end, work up until the end of the board vertically (8)
		- Start at one end, work up until the end of the board horizontally (8)
		- Move piece with a piece in the way
